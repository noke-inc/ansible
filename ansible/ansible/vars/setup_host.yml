  # Letsencrypt: Default solution installs cert automatically for your backend generated by letsencrypt.org
  # Pregenerated means that you provide cert bundle which you have bought or generated yourself and placed in
  # the path described in wnt_keychain: parameter
  #
  # Self signed certs are not recommended for production env.
  # It is much faster and easier in terms of configuration to use trusted certificate from
  # trusted certificate provider.
  #
  # It creates a new self-signed certificate to server and client and binds the created bundle.pem to
  # wnt_keychain.
  # With self signed backend you need to copy the client_bundle.pem from WNT backend into your WIN machine
  # and add it as trusted root certificate authorities in Microsoft Management Console
  # This enables WNT-Client to be able to connect to this this backend with self signed certificate.
  # NOTE: you should modify playbooks/roles/certs/defaults/main.yml according to the your
  # backend server and organization
  #
  # No cert means that backend is unsecure and no cert is needed. Not for production!
